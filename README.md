# Data_Analysis_with_Machine_Learning

In my project I have 2 excel files that are ProjectDataset.xlsx and ProjectResult.xlsx.

The ProjectDataset.xlsx file is for dataset. In the dataset, I have 120 rows and 8 columns, in the columns, I have 6 features(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6) for training and testing also have 1 label which is Y and that one is for the result. But the thing that I have only 100 Y filled result in my dataset, that is why I have to predict the last 20 Y values with the best machine learning algorithm.  

The ProjectFolder is the main project, I have written it with Python.
